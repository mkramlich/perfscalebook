TODO

items.py:
    finish specifying all the w and s relations
    elim the quick and dirty .80s wrap hack
    retire the old numbers (the (id)'s)

special to generic relations:
    memoization to caching
    well-cached dynamic app site becomes increasingly a more de facto static site)
    many items will be special cases of "do little as possible"; "do nothing" is most extreme version of it

write a full "per item" chapter, as a candidate/template. ok if not perfect/final
    candidates for 1st:
        parallelization; caching; stat-not-dyn; memoization
        langs: Python and Go

script to generate all artifacts (like book epub/mobi, and cheatsheet pdf) (pandoc?)

structured "book source" text format. eg. Markdown. or ad hoc via Python?

blurbs on general theory and practice?
    bottlenecks
    distributions and percentiles
    measurement precision
    noise
    cold vs warm
    queue system models (like Gunther)

New Item Candidates

to maximize hash rates for cryptocurrency/blockchain mining: ASIC > GPU > CPU (may be redundant to existing)

shorter wires/fibers (distances between components in compute system) (needs thought. feels redundant with existing)
