TODO

items file in a structured format like Python
	auto-count (assign number for each)
	use item codes/abbrevs to refer to other items

special to generic relations:
	memoization to caching
	well-cached dynamic app site becomes increasingly a more de facto static site)

write a full "per item" chapter, as a candidate/template. ok if not perfect/final
	candidates for 1st: parallelization; caching; stat-not-dyn; memoization

script to generate all artifacts (like book epub/mobi, and cheatsheet pdf)

structured "book source" text format. eg. Markdown. or ad hoc via Python? pandoc?
