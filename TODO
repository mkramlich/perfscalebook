items.py:
    use item codes/abbrevs to refer to other items

special to generic relations:
    memoization to caching
    well-cached dynamic app site becomes increasingly a more de facto static site)

write a full "per item" chapter, as a candidate/template. ok if not perfect/final
    candidates for 1st: parallelization; caching; stat-not-dyn; memoization

script to generate all artifacts (like book epub/mobi, and cheatsheet pdf)

structured "book source" text format. eg. Markdown. or ad hoc via Python? pandoc?

blurbs on general theory and practice?
    bottlenecks
    distributions and percentiles
    measurement precision
    noise
    cold vs warm
    queue system models (like Gunther)
