TODO

extract a list of item candidates from my cheatsheet (including from other TODOs and new candidates below)

write a full "per item" chapter, as a candidate/template. ok if not perfect/final
	candidates for 1st: parallelization; caching; stat-not-dyn; memoization

script to generate all artifacts (like book epub/mobi, and cheatsheet pdf)

structured "book source" text format. eg. Markdown. or ad hoc via Python?

------------

New Item Candidates

elastic microservices arch for greater scalability, resiliency

uniform distribution of tasks across a regular time window where possible (eg. say you have 100 servers which must be rebooted one per day (and a server reboot takes typically max of 2 minutes), you donâ€™t reboot them all at the same moment, but spread them out evenly so never more than 1 server rebooting at any point during any 24 hour window) NOTE this is very close to existing #94 and 93

random jigging/jittering of attempt tries to avoid stampedes

assembly. inline ASM (like in C)

add some cloud, NN, ML and "data science" specific items to candidate list, where distinction warrants

TODO some in my notes on phone?
