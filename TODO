items.py:
    finish specifying all the w and s relations
    elim the quick and dirty .80s wrap hack
    retire the old numbers (the (id)'s)
    consider just printing the alias/relations as a stripped one-line dict
    consider switching trait keys to single letters (easier typing, worse grepping)
    add a domain trait. eg. web, graphics, video, audio, memory, disk/storage, database, hardware, cloud, network, OS, space/aero, embedded/IoT...
    traits for tradeoffs or optimization goals? (eg. more cpu, less disk; more cpu, less bandwidth; less latency, more redundancy; etc.)
    traits for tools which are helpful/relevant to each item?
    cleanup/simplify names of the new items (post 109)
    separate names from the side comments (like I did in legacy #1 Do Nothing)

special to generic relations:
    distributed to parallelization (and kinda former way-to-achieve the latter)
    many items will be special cases of "do little as possible"; "do nothing" is most extreme version of it

write a full "per item" chapter, as a candidate/template. ok if not perfect/final
    candidates for 1st:
        parallelization; caching; stat-not-dyn; memoization
        langs: Python and Go
    item-specific subdirs?

script to generate all artifacts (like book epub/mobi, and cheatsheet pdf) (pandoc?)

structured "book source" text format. eg. Markdown. or ad hoc via Python?

blurbs on general theory and practice?
    bottlenecks
    distributions and percentiles
    measurement precision
    noise
    cold vs warm
    queue system models (like Gunther)

New Item Candidates

to maximize hash rates for cryptocurrency/blockchain mining: ASIC > GPU > CPU (may be redundant to existing)

shorter wires/fibers (distances between components in compute system) (needs thought. feels redundant with existing)

is "horizontal scaling" worth its own item? since one of the very biggest shotguns (along with caching/static). somewhat overlap with distributed, and is one reason for distributed (along with parallel) but not only reason
